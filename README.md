<h1>Sniffing for Services</h1>

<p>The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) is an independent Australian Federal government agency responsible for scientific research. As a result, CSIRO publishes a large amount of scientific data both internally and externally. Some of the data it publishes is via web services, both standard and custom. Despite sophisticated server management tools, it is very hard to know what services are installed across all CSIRO publication systems as a lot of the data services are ad hoc and not catalogued. It’s even harder to know, centrally, what the published data is about. 

The main goal of the project is to help CSIRO identify and catalogue data services. The outcome of the project should help users like research scientists in CSIRO to search and discover what data services are available on the CSIRO network. A NASA web service, based on Thredds data server, is a good example for the project to start with to make query, which contains a catalogue for different datasets.

This project is to write code to interrogate CSIRO’s internal and external web presences and hunt for particular service technologies. This involve polling for open ports known to support specific applications and testing endpoints with a range of requests standard services are known to answer. Once discovered and identified, it is required to design a data structure like a database that is used to make queries of the descriptions of data exposed by the services and map them to standard dictionaries of data description terms.</p>
